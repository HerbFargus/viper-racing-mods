This batch file will reverse the racing direction in Viper Racing on a track path you made and wanted the forward racing direction in the game to be opposite to start with.
Just put this batch file in the folder where you used Sucahyos vrtrackmaker tool to make a track and double click the batch file.Now when you put the track together , the racing direction in the game will be reversed to start with.
