Put your carname.car in this folder.
Make a readme.
In the game , screen shot your car , example car name: 43Chevy.car.
In a paint program make a 320 x 240 pixels jpg to show in carman with your car screen shot.
Name of the jpg must be identical to the name of your car - example: 43Chevy.jpg
Zip or rar all those files and upload somewhere.
I can put your car on my Viper Racing website  http://vnovak.com
My email is in any car or track readme.
Thanks !
